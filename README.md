# shOTS-FIRED
CANT STAY STILL
I DONT CARE WHO WATCHES 
BUT WATCH IT
AND LOOK AT HIS EYES 
DEATH COULDNT KILL EM 
HE TALKS TO ME EVERYNIGHT
OVERDOZED WITH A SERINGE STILL STIKING TO HIS COLD 
10 YEAR OLD
OVER DOOH ON LIFE
THATS WERE HE LIKED IT
THATS WERE HE SHOT
MOTHER WAS ADDICTED
THE TRAIN WAS ALREADY OFF THE TRACKS
SO  EERYNIGHT I SMOKE A BOWL FOR EM
AND REMEBER WHAT HE ASK'S
@ 27 HOW COME I STILL DONT FEEL LIKE A MAN




why do we live to die
and then bury our bodies
I GUESS ITS SO YOU CANT TOUCH ME 
YOU CANT TELL ME NOTHING
YOU PAID TO PUT MY BODY 7 FEET UNDER GROUND 
ITS NOT CAUSE YOU LIKE ME ITS CAUSE YOU KNEW ME




ITS NOT CAUSE I LIKE YOU
ITS CAUSE 
NASTY
it must be cause 


this is the new world
or the most reacent
 






WHAT WERE YOURE LAST WORDS BEFORE YOU DIED
IS IT FUNNER THEN THE OTHER SIDE
 



THATS
